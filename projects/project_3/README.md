# Social_Network_Ads

The Dataset contains information about users on a Social Networking site and using that
information as features for our ML model, the model predicts whether a particular user after clicking on an ad on the Social
networking site goes on to buy a particular product or not. It is a CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM as the output says whether the user
buys the product or not, so itâ€™s either a yes or a no. Well this particular Social Network has a Business client which lets assume 
is a car company which advertises itself by putting adds on the social networking site. Now the work of the social network here is 
to gather information as to whether the user bought the product or not.
